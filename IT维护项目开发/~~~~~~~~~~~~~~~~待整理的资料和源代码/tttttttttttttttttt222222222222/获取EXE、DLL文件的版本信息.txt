How can I extract the version information stored in the RT_VERSION resource in an .exe/.dll file?

 You can use the following Win32 api's to it: GetFileVersionInfo(), GetFileVersionInfoSize() and VerQueryValue(), defined in winver.h. Basically, the process is: Get the size of the memory block needed for the resource, by using GetFileVersionInfoSize(). Then, allocate memory, and call GetFileVersionInfo(). Then , just use VerQueryValue() to extract the relevant info.
